            The Marauders are a group of resurrected and corrupted Night Sentinels who sided with the Khan Maykr and the Hell Priests against the realm of Argent D'Nur by becoming demonic sentinels. As former members of the Doom Slayer's personal band of warriors, they have access to a wide range of very powerful techniques that make them one of the most challenging and deadly foes the player will face over the course of the campaign.           </span>

          As civil war consumed Argent D'Nur, the Night Sentinels Guard was quartered by their faith. Torn between serving the Khan Maykr or revolting against that which they swore to protect. Those most disillusioned forswore their oath to the Sentinel royalty, abandoning their pact of allegiance made to the throne. These hardened warriors joined the separatist group led by the exalted Priest class, allying themselves with the Maykrs and their devout acolytes in an attempted coup against the Sentinel royal house. Those Sentinel warriors who fell in battle, having sided with the Maykrs, were ultimately denied finality in death. Resurrected by the Divinity Machine of Maykr design, these fallen Sentinels were returned from the dead, transformed by Hell's power, and recreated with a singular purpose: to hunt the Slayer, now reborn as Knights in Hell's army.        </div>
