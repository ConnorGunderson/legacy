        What our customers had to say:
      </h2>
      <div class="h-full w-full grid" style="overflow:visible;">
        <div>
          "Against all the evil that Hell can conjure, all the wickedness that mankind can produce, we will send unto them... only you. Rip and tear, until it is done."
          — King Novik, opening
        </div>
        <div>
          "What you interfere with now is bigger than you can imagine. It is written, it is their time to give penance - if you continue you will bring down the heaven's wrath. You are but one man - they are no longer your people to save!"
          — King Novik
        </div>
        <div>
          "I thought you would appreciate the sentry I chose. The great Agaddon Hunters from the Telos Realm, though long thought to be extinct, created to hunt only the Slayer and his Night Sentinels during the Unholy Crusade... Some improvements on the design have been made; enjoy what is undoubtedly my finest work."
          — Deag Ranak, DOOM Hunter Reveal
        </div>
        <div>
          "I told you all to leave me here. I am where I belong... Saving your people will not bring you peace. Only make the burden you carry worse. And now you seek to defy the Khan Maykr herself? It is your people's time to give penance... Just as it was mine. Hear me, Slayer. When his heart is laid to rest, then his soul will be at peace... and so will mine."
          — The Betrayer
        </div>
        <div>
          "For millennia we have survived. Made others sacrifice in the name of our prosperity - so that they may in turn find redemption. Who are you, a human, once a mortal, to defy our traditions?"
— The Khan Maykr
        </div>
        <div>
          "You were never one of us. You were nothing but a usurper...a false idol. My eyes have been opened. Let me help you to see, Slayer."
— The Marauder
        </div>
        <div>
          "DANGER. ALL PERSONNEL EVACUATE TO MARS SURFACE. THE SLAYER HAS CONTROL OF THE BFG. REPEAT, THE SLAYER HAS THE BFG."
— Phobos intercom, right after the Doom Slayer obtains the BFG-9000
        </div>
        <div>
          "... guts, huge guts! Kill them... must kill them all! [...] Rip... And... Tear! The demons... they are everywhere. Must... kill them all!"
        </div>
        <div>
          "For he will walk among us, and he will smite the evil from this earth. For he who comes in our time of need is not of mortal breed, he is the Destroyer, the right hand of our Creator and the one who brings fear where there is no hope."
— Corrax Tablet 3:13
